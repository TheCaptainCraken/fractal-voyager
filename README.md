# Fractal Voyager

>This program enables you to travel inside a 3d fractal rendered in real time.

## Try it

To run the program you first need to be on linux (why? because I am lazy and I have written a makefile only for linux). Be sure to have Raylib installed on your system as a shared library. After that you can just:

```bash
make release
./build/release/fractal-voyager
```
