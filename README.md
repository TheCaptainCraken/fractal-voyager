# Fractal Voyager

>This program enables you to travel inside a 3d fractal rendered in real time.

## Features

This is a list of feratures I would like to implement. I will probably add more later.

1. Rendering a 3d fractal using raymarching.
  - Possibility of choosing the fractal from a menu.
  - Lighing.
  - Colors.
2. Travelling around and inside the fractal.

## Try it

To run the program you first need to be on linux (why? because I am lazy and I have written a makefile only for linux). Be sure to have Raylib installed on your system as a shared library. After that you can just:

```bash
make release
./build/release/fractal-voyager
```
